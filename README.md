# smartdoor: Smart Door Lock

![3D Design Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/hdZur5S.png)

## What
This repo is the codebase for an automatic door locking/unlocking device
The device locks the door when all of the devices it's pinging leave bluetooth range and unlocks the door when any device comes within range

## Why
There's no good reason why; I was just too lazy and wished my door would automatically lock behind me. This device definitely didn't need to exist, but it was definitely fun to make.

## How
* 3D-printed frame
* Raspberry Pi Zero WH
* 20 kg servo motor (definitely overkill)
* Dodgy soldering & janky wiring
